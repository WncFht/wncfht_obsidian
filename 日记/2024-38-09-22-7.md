- 感觉最近的生活真的一坨屎，毫无掌控感
- 以后也许可以每天早上做个反思，然后晚上也做个反思
- I should try to record my daily life in order to reflect on myself.
- do weekly, monthly, every semester TODO list and schedule
- and organize the notes everyday but not do it when I have to.
- don't avoiding the big problem like
	- who I want to be 
	- what I really want to do 
	- what kind of life do I want to live
	- what is important to me
	- did the day schedule could be better if I rearrange it
- the content of reconsidering 
	- the class time and homework
		- what's the my own plan for the class
	- the other route I'm going on
		- how is the progress
		- what revision do I need to make to the plan
	- anything new route will be added
- then MAKE A APPROPRIATE PLAN
