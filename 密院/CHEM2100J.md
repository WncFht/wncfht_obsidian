- It states that in an isolated system, the entropy either remains constant or increases during any spontaneous process.

### 8.3 Entropy and Disorder

- Entropy is a state function that measures the degree of disorder in a system.
- High entropy indicates greater disorder, while low entropy indicates more order.

### 8.4 Spontaneous Change

- Spontaneous changes occur naturally without external influences, such as a gas expanding into a vacuum.
- The tendency of a reaction to be spontaneous is related to the change in entropy and enthalpy.

### 8.5 Nonspontaneous Change

- Nonspontaneous changes require external work to occur and are often counter to the natural tendency of a system.

### 8.6 Entropy and Disorder: Quantitative

- Ludwig Boltzmann proposed that entropy is related to the number of microstates (W) a system can occupy, given by the formula S=kBln⁡WS=kB​lnW, where kBkB​ is Boltzmann's constant.

### 8.11 Standard Molar Entropies

- The standard molar entropy of a substance at a given temperature can be calculated using heat capacities measured over a range of temperatures.

### 8.12 Global Changes in Entropy: Total

- The total entropy change of a process includes both the system and its surroundings, and it must be positive for a spontaneous process.

### 8.13 Equilibrium

- At equilibrium, the total entropy change is zero, meaning there is no net tendency for a process to proceed in either direction.

### 8.14 Gibbs Free Energy

- Gibbs free energy (G) is used to determine the spontaneity of a process and is defined as G=H−TSG=H−TS, where HH is the enthalpy, TT is the temperature, and SS is the entropy.

## 10 CHEM2100J Chapter 10 - Chemical Equilibrium

### 10.1 Chapter Overview

- This chapter covers the concept of chemical equilibrium, including how and why reactions establish equilibrium, and how equilibria are affected by changes in conditions.

### 10.2 Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch

- Discusses the historical context of chemical equilibrium, particularly the work of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch on the synthesis of ammonia.

### 10.3 Chemical Equilibrium

- Chemical equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.

### 10.4 Equilibrium and the Law of Mass Action

- The law of mass action states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.

### 10.5 Equilibrium Measurements

- Equilibrium constants can be expressed in terms of either concentrations (Kc) or partial pressures (Kp).

### 10.6 The Direction of Reaction Depending on Q

- The reaction quotient (Q) is used to predict the direction a reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium.

### 10.7 Alternative Forms of the Equilibrium Constant

- Different forms of the equilibrium constant can be derived based on the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation.

### 10.8 Using Equilibrium Constants

- How to calculate K from known equilibrium concentrations and vice versa.

### 10.9 The Response of Equilibria to Change

- How equilibria respond to changes such as the addition or removal of reactants or products, and changes in pressure and temperature.

### 10.10 Le Chatelier's Principle

- States that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium will shift to counteract the change.

### 10.11 The Effect of Temperature on K

- Van't Hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant (K) to temperature changes.

### 10.12 Catalysts and Haber’s Achievement

- Catalysts increase the rate of a reaction but do not affect the equilibrium position.

### 10.13 Summary

- Recap of the key points regarding chemical equilibrium, including how to predict and calculate equilibria, and the effects of various factors on equilibria.
